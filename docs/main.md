# ClusterDuck Protocol Info

## About
The ClusterDuck Protocol is an open-source firmware for creating mesh network Internet-of-Things devices leveraging LoRa radio technology, with optional WiFi and Bluetooth compatibility. Designed for rapid deployment, this protocol facilitates wireless communication, sensor integration, and network device connectivity in areas lacking conventional infrastructure.

## Origin Story
Emerging from the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017, the ClusterDuck Protocol by OWL Integrations enables essential communication in disaster-stricken regions through a mobile mesh network accessible without pre-downloaded software. The protocol's development was inspired by the need for a reliable, low-cost, and easy-to-deploy communication solution in disaster relief scenarios.

## How It Works
The protocol's network consists of nodes known as **Ducks**, playing one of three core roles: 
- **DuckLinks**: Edge nodes transmitting data, acting as remote sensors or portal access points.
- **MamaDucks**: Nodes receiving and repeating messages, bridging DuckLinks and the network's backbone.
- **PapaDucks**: The network's culmination points, aggregating data for storage or cloud upload.
